"TCP On Blockchain" or "Redesign TCP with Blockchain technology"

Today, the Blockchain become very popular topic in the computer industry. In this paper I will try to combine this popular technology with the backbone technology of the Internet â€“ a TCP protocol.

In a nutshell, the Blockchain technology talks about creating chain of messages/blocks. Each block consists of a hash of the previous block coupled with some data. The data can be for example transactions. Blockchain implementation uses special hash function. No one can change the blocks that are already in the chain, without recalculating all aftermath blocks hashes.
